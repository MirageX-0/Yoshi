<h1>After Fifty Years</h1>

Her house is empty and her heart is old,<br/>
And filled with shades and echoes that deceive<br/>
No one save her, for still she tries to weave<br/>
With blind bent fingers, nets that cannot hold.<br/>
Once all men’s arms rose up to her, ‘tis told,<br/>
And hovered like white birds for her caress:<br/>
A crown she could have had to bind each tress<br/>
Of hair, and her sweet arms the Witches’ Gold.<br/>

Her mirrors know her witnesses, for there<br/>
She rose in dreams from other dreams that lent<br/>
Her softness as she stood, crowned with soft hair.<br/>
And with his bound heart and his young eyes bent<br/>
And blind, he feels her presence like shed scent,<br/>
Holding him body and life within its snare.<br/>
<br/>
